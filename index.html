                            When you look up something on Google, is your computer connecting to the Cloud? Are your favorite movies and TV shows stored up high in the clouds? Is your phone backed up high in the clouds? Well, in a sense. Cloud usually means 'someone else's computer' in the case of Google, Cloud are Google's massive data centers. Your movie and TV shows are stored in physical disks in enormous data centers that we call "cloud" today, and if you have an iPhone with iCloud backup, your phone is backed up to servers in Apple's data centers...

                            Well, Google does not have a bunch of wires each going to a different network like your ISP. That would be too many wires, too costly, and too difficult to maintain. Instead, Google connects to Internet eXchange Points (IXP), a location where multiple networks connect. Companies usually have connections to one or more Tier-1 network(s)...

                            There are two IP versions, IPv4 and IPv6. IPv4 is probably what you think of when you think about an IP address: something like "192.168.0.1". IPv4 addresses can range from 0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255, which leaves you with 4,294,967,296 possible IP addresses. As the internet became more and more popular, everyone's home began to have its own IP address. Unfortunately, the "over-allocation" of addresses has resulted in a shortage of IPv4 addresses...

                            For the following tutorial I will be using Debian 11 in a Vultr VPS with Vultr as my upstream. Vultr (and some other transit providers) requires you to provide them with a LoA (Letter of Authorization), allowing them to transit your IP Prefix and your ASN. This can be done easily via https://loa.tools, plugging in your ASN's information and Vultr's (AS20473) information...

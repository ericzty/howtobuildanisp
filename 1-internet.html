When you look up something on Google, is your computer connecting to the Cloud? Are your favorite movies and TV shows stored up high in the clouds? Is your phone backed up high in the clouds? Well, in a sense. Cloud usually means 'someone else's computer' in the case of Google, Cloud are Google's massive data centers. Your movie and TV shows are stored in physical disks in enormous data centers that we call "cloud" today, and if you have an iPhone with iCloud backup, your phone is backed up to servers in Apple's data centers.
<br>
<br>
But how does your device connect to other people's computers? I'm sure you all know it's with the internet, but how exactly does that work? Does your Internet Service Provider (the company that gives your home internet or your phone's wireless provider) have a line that goes directly from your home to Google's data center? Well, not quite; the cable from your home or from your 4G/5G towers connects to your ISP's data center, where they have connections to all the other networks(i.e., other ISPs, companies, etc.) on the internet.
<br>
<br>
Every connection on the internet originates from an IP address. For example, your phone has an IP address, and your devices in your home that are connected to the internet also have an IP address. An IP Address is like a street address. When you connect to websites on the internet, it's almost like sending mail to another person's house or a corporation's address.
<br>
<br>
So when you look up something on Google, your device sends the request from its IP address to Google's server at the IP address 172.253.115.113. It will go through other devices, like your router, your ISP's router, and Google's routers, until it reaches 172.253.115.113. Then Google's server will send the response back to your device's IP address.
<br>
<br>
But how does the ISP know where 172.253.115.113 is? Does Google just have a bunch of cables connecting its data center to other ISPs?

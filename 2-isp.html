Well, Google does not have a bunch of wires each going to a different network like your ISP. That would be too many wires, too costly, and too difficult to maintain. Instead, Google connects to Internet eXchange Points (IXP), a location where multiple networks connect. Companies usually have connections to one or more Tier-1 network(s)(networks that can connect to every other network on the internet with peering agreements.)
<br>
<br>
A peering agreement is an agreement between two networks to connect to reach a more extensive network. Networks of similar size usually do this to eliminate any need for payment as it is mutually beneficial. For smaller networks connecting to a bigger network like a Tier-1 ISP, called "transit", and usually incurs a cost for the smaller network receiving said "transit". Different networks can have their own peering policy, such as open peering, which allows any network to peer with them. There's also selective peering policy, where they only allow some networks to peer with them, usually networks of similar size.
<br>
<br>
What makes up a network? Two things, an ASN and IP prefix(s).
<br>
<br>
An ASN is an identifying number (like a license plate) that network routers use with BGP to identify each other. Most large companies, like Google (AS15169), Amazon (AS16509), and Meta (AS32934), all own an ASN. Every time you visit a website, your ISP sends a packet from its ASN to the website's ISP's ASN. <a href="https://infernocomms.com/articles/asn"><i><b>More on ASNs here</i></b></a>.
<br>
<br>
An IP Address is like a street address. When you connect to websites on the internet, it's almost like sending mail to another person's house or a corporation's address. You probably have a home IP address that comes from your Internet Service Provider's pool of IP addresses, which we call an IP "block" or IP "prefix." <a href="https://infernocomms.com/articles/ipv6"><i><b>More on IP Prefixes here</i></b></a>.
<br>
<br>
How exactly do two networks connect? You probably can't just wire a cable between two routers and expect it to magically work. This is where BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) comes in: BGP is a protocol that helps facilitate communications between two networks to exchange routes(IP prefixes). In short, two networks use BGP to tell each other what IP addresses can be reached via them.
